<INGRESS>
Around
1000
pieces
of
the
Nokia
M510
web
tablet
were
produced
in
2001
—
nine
years
before
the
first
iPad
.

But
according
to
Nokia
´
s
market
research
the
consumers
weren
'
t
ready
for
the
device
.

There
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
when
it
comes
to
technology
of
the
device
.

This
was
top
notch
of
the
era
.

<PARAGRAPH>
So
says
communications
telecommunications
expert
Mr.
Esko
Yliruusi
who
was
part
of
the
team
responsible
for
creation
of
the
tablet
.

The
device
was
never
to
see
release
.

<PARAGRAPH>
There
is
some
pride
in
Yliruusi
'
s
voice
.

It
'
s
no
wonder
.

The
Nokia
510
web
tablet
went
into
production
nine
years
before
the
first
iPad
hit
the
market
.

<PARAGRAPH>
A
hint
of
the
device
was
dropped
last
week
when
journalist
David
J.
Cord
revealed
in
his
book
"
The
Decline
and
Fall
of
Nokia
"
that
the
company
had
plans
for
a
tablet
computer
.

<PARAGRAPH>
According
to
Cord
the
project
was
dropped
45
minutes
before
the
device
went
into
production
.

The
information
is
slightly
incorrect
.

The
project
was
indeed
dropped
–
but
not
before
a
production
run
of
around
1000
devices
was
completed
.

<PARAGRAPH>
Most
of
the
devices
ended
up
in
the
crusher

<PARAGRAPH>
Mr.
Yliruusi
participated
in
the
project
from
early
2001
until
August
when
the
project
was
dropped
.

His
responsibilities
were
of
testing
the
communications
capabilities
of
the
device
.

The
tablet
did
actually
go
into
production
.

The
order
to
stop
didn
'
t
come
before
that
,
Yliruusi
corrects
the
information
in
the
book
.

<PARAGRAPH>
According
to
Mr.
Yliruusi
the
project
was
suspended
because
the
device
was
too
much
ahead
of
its
time
.

A
market
research
was
conducted
and
the
results
showed
that
there
was
no
demand
for
the
product
.

<PARAGRAPH>
–
It
was
stated
that
it
is
not
yet
the
time
for
a
device
like
this
,
tells
Mr.
Yliruusi
.

<PARAGRAPH>
–
It
was
a
marvelous
concept
but
nothing
the
consumers
would
yet
accept
,
he
continues
.

Mr.
Yliruusi
says
that
he
is
not
able
to
assess
whether
the
decision
was
a
wise
one
or
not
.

<PARAGRAPH>
There
are
approximately
130
surviving
devices
.

The
development
team
got
tablets
of
their
own
as
a
farewell
gift
.

Rest
of
the
devices
were
scrapped
.

<PARAGRAPH>
–
I
had
a
strong
feeling
that
this
one
is
a
keeper
.

There
were
things
in
the
device
that
were
done
just
as
they
should
be
.

I
felt
that
we
shall
be
hearing
of
gadgets
like
this
,
tells
Mr.
Yliruusi
of
his
feelings
at
the
time
.

<PARAGRAPH>
After
the
termination
of
the
project
the
development
team
was
sacked
.

Some
were
re-employed
by
Nokia
.

Like
many
others
Mr.
Yliruusi
sought
employment
elsewhere
.

These
days
he
runs
a
company
called
Networker
who
he
is
a
founder
and
owner
of
.

The
tablet
has
been
a
well-kept
secret
up
until
now
.

Before
the
publication
of
the
original
Finnish
language
article
there
were
no
mentions
of
the
M510
on
the
Internet
.

<PARAGRAPH>
The
tablet
was
intended
to
be
a
true
consumer
product
.

It
had
an
email
client
,
Opera
web
browser
,
a
calendar
and
a
noticeboard
application
.

There
was
a
stand
to
keep
the
device
in
an
upright
position
on
the
kitchen
table
.

<PARAGRAPH>
Technically
speaking
the
tablet
was
an
example
of
up-to-date
technology
.

But
as
it
never
hit
the
stores
there
was
no
one
to
write
any
software
for
it.

<PARAGRAPH>
–
Had
the
lifespan
of
the
device
been
a
year
or
two
longer
and
had
somebody
made
it
run
Linux
it
could
have
evolved
into
anything
.

The
next
version
would
have
weighted
half
of
this
,
reflects
Yliruusi
.

<PARAGRAPH>
The
operating
system
is
one
thing
.

Applications
are
another
.

Yliruusi
speculates
whether
there
could
have
been
an
ecosystem
based
on
the
M510
.

<PARAGRAPH>
–
The
tablet
was
before
mobile
ecosystem
thinking
.

You
wouldn
'
t
have
had
any
applications
for
it.

<PARAGRAPH>
Did
something
carry
over
to
future
devices
?

The
M510
tablet
was
never
to
be
.

Nokia
didn
'
t
release
its
first
internet
device
until
four
years
later
.

2005
'
s
Nokia
770
sported
a
four
inch
screen
and
looked
more
like
a
smart
phone
of
the
era
than
tablet
.

Despite
some
healthy
sales
is
wasn
'
t
exactly
a
smash
hit
.

<PARAGRAPH>
Mr.
Yliruusi
believes
that
some
things
were
carried
over
from
M510
to
Nokia
770.

When
Nokia
770
was
launched
I
had
the
feeling
that
all
of
our
work
hadn
'
t
gone
to
waste
.

It
seemed
like
some
things
were
picked
up
from
the
old
design
.

And
finally
they
made
the
right
operating
system
choice
.

<PARAGRAPH>
Nokia
770
run
Maemo
which
later
transformed
into
Meego
.

It
was
Nokia
'
s
planned
successor
to
the
already
obsolete
Symbian
OS
.

<PARAGRAPH>
But
this
was
also
not
to
be
.

Soon
after
Stephen
Elop
took
over
as
the
CEO
of
Nokia
he
chose
Windows
Phone
over
Meego
.

<PARAGRAPH>
The
rest
is
history
.

Not
unlike
many
other
ex-Nokians
the
Microsoft
acquisition
of
Nokia
'
s
phone
business
was
a
bitter
pill
for
Esko
Yliruusi
.

<PARAGRAPH>
–
Yes
,
I
felt
bad
.

I
decided
that
I
'
m
not
getting
any
more
of
these
,
says
Mr.
Yliruusi
waving
his
Nokia
Lumia
.

phone
will
